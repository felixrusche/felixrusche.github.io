If information provided by politicians is circulated in ideologically segregated user networks, political polarization may be fostered. Using network information on all 1.78 million unique followers of German Members of Parliament by October 2018, follower homogeneity across politicians and parties is measured. While the overall homogeneity is low, politicians of the AfD —a right-wing populist party —stand out with very homogeneous follower networks. These are largely driven by a small group of strongly committed partisans that make up around 7 percent of the party’s but around 55-75 percent of the average AfD politician’s followers. The findings add to the literature by showing potentially unequal distributions of network segregation on Twitter. Further, they suggest that small groups of active users can multiply their influence online, which has important implications for future research on echo chambers and other online phenomena.","tags":null,"title":"Few voices, strong echo: Measuring follower homogeneity of politicians’ Twitter accounts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felix Rusche","Yulia Evsyukova","Wladislaw Mill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"2e3c32d0271701711eed87a9982645ab","permalink":"https:://felixrusche.github.io/publication/workinprogress-2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/workinprogress-2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Work in Progress"],"title":"Discriminiation in Job Network Formation: Evidence from a Field Experiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felix Rusche","Antonio Ciccone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"5ba1cf05cb9324ee8b541ae3cab41b99","permalink":"https:://felixrusche.github.io/publication/workinprogress-3/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/workinprogress-3/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Work in Progress"],"title":"Dissecting Media Bias: Daily Stock Market Performance in the News","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felix Rusche"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"65431e14470d5d595d2e0d0213c74ea5","permalink":"https:://felixrusche.github.io/publication/workinprogress-1/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/workinprogress-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Work in Progress"],"title":"Media for Development: Evidence from India","type":"publication"}]
